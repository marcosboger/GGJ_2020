  DialogueText: 'Alex really hoped to be free now, but luck it''s not on his side
    this day...This is the second level of the game, one even more messed up.

    And he sees something strange in the level...a monster!

    "Arrgh! The horrible monster!"

    "WHERE?!"

    The strange creature looks at him...confused and scared...then angry when It realizes
    Alex meant he was referring to HIM.

    "That was very rude, I am deeply offended!"

    "But...Who are you?"

    Alex is extremely confused by this surprise.

    "Want to know? Reach the next level, if you can, and maybe I will tell you"'
