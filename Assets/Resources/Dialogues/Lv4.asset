  DialogueText: 'Viruz is very surprised that Alex solved the level and reached the
    end, coming in to the fourth one.

    "Damn you, why did you do that?

    That poor random code did nothing wrong..."

    Alex looks at him smugly

    "There is no code or bug I can''t fix, Viruz!

    It''s better for you to remember this!"

    The virus laughs:

    "Really? The programmers in the Physic department where saying the same, and they
    are still wrestling with my marvelous codes...let''s see if you can solve THIS
    level then!"'
