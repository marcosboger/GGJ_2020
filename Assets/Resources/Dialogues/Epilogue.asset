  DialogueText: "Viruz Screams with annoyance when Alex reaches the end of the level
    and finishes the game.\n\"Dammit! Now this game it's so boring and clean! Just
    like you!\nI'm leaving, the physicist are vay funnier than you!\"\nAnd just in
    time, before his colleagues wake up, Alex is launched back onto the chair, disoriented\u2026but
    no\r\nlonger pixelated!\r\nAnd with a game perfectly clean and shining!\r\r\nHe
    looked amused at the flashing lights, happy about having defeated a now extremely
    frustrated Viruz.\r\nThat night Alex\u2019s game is celebrated for being the best
    game of the Jam, and Alex acclaimed like an hero\r for having cleaned the most
    bugged game of recent history.\r\nSo much, that a couple days later he receives
    a work offer from the physics department\u2026"
