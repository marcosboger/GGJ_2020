  DialogueText: "Year 2XXX\r\nGlobal Game Jam, Politecnico di Milano\r\nAlex Pogrammo
    has been awake for the last 36 hours, and with little time left before the end
    of the Jam\r he has been fighting with a bug/glitch filled game for the last 18
    hours, and He\u2019s going crazy.\r\nHis colleagues are sleeping, exausted by
    the inhuman challenge, but Alex keeps going, ignoring tiredness... Which strikes
    at the least expected moment when, returning from a little toilet break, he tramples
    in one of\r the cables on the floor, falling headfirst in the computer screen.\r.."
