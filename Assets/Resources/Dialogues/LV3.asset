  DialogueText: 'The monster seems very annoyed when Alex reaches the third level
    of the game.

    "That was just luck"

    Alex points at him.

    "Tell what you want, now I DEMAND to know who are you!""

    "I am VIRUZ, the king of games!

    I have seen this game, full of ordinated code, and polished functions...so BORING.

    I am randomizing it a bit"

    Alex is furious at this now

    "So it''s YOUR fault I stayed awake for the last 36 hours"

    "Don''t blame me for your caffeine addiction...let''s see if you can solve this
    puzzle now!"'
